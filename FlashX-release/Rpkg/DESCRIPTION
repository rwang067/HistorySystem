Title: Scale R for massive datasets
Author: See AUTHORS file.
Maintainer: Da Zheng <dzheng5@jhu.edu>
Description: FlashR extends the R programming framework. It executes R code
	in parallel automatically and stores and accesses arrays in the R code on
	disks automatically to scale R to large datasets that can't fit in memory.
	FlashR reimplements many commonly used R functions to execute existing R
	code. In addition, FlashR provides a small set of generalized operators to
	express data mining and machine learning algorithms that cannot be expressed
	with existing R functions efficiently.
